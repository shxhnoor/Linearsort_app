# Linear Search Visualization

To check that my Track and Field Linear search app worked efficiently and had met its requirements, I tested the I tested my Track and Field Linear Search app by using a range of inputs, including normal cases, worst-case, best-case and user input edge cases. I will also be providing video and picture evidence of every test below to clearly demonstrate accuracy of its algorithm, UI interaction, and functionality.  
# TEST CASES 
Normal case: 
The average case here is where the athlete one would be looking for is placed in the middle of the heat list. The program checks lanes before finding their name linearly, so it takes more steps than the best case but fewer steps than the worst case. 

Worst case:  
The worst case is where the runner is in the last lane or isn’t in the heat at all. The program has to go through every single lane before finding them or verifying they were missing. This scenario inevitably takes the longest, showing the maximum time the linear search algorithm can maintain. 

Best case: 
The best case here would be an instance where the runner is put in the very first lane of the heat. The program would find them immediately, so only one check is needed throughout the whole scenario. This is the fastest way as it shows how efficiently the algorithm works when the athletes name is at the beginning
